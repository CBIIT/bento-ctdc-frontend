    - paragraph: "$$#CRDC:#$$"
    - paragraph: "$$[The Cancer Research DataCommons](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons)$$ is an initiative from NCI’s Center for Biomedical
        Informatics & Information Technology ($$[CBIIT](https://datascience.cancer.gov/)$$). CBIIT’s vision for the project consists of a 
        virtual, expandable infrastructure that provides secure access to many different data types across scientific domains, 
        allowing users to analyze, share, and store results, leveraging the storage and elastic compute, or ability to easily scale resources, of the 
        cloud. The ability to combine diverse data types and perform cross-domain analysis of large data sets can lead to new discoveries in cancer prevention, 
        treatment and diagnosis, and supports the goals of precision medicine and the Cancer Moonshot℠."
    - paragraph: "Users can query the CTDC data via Graphical User Interface (GUI) or APIs. The GUI provides users a distilled set of parameters (faceted querying) they can use to explore the CTDC data. The APIs provide access to the full collection of parameters as seen in the $$[CTDC Data Model](https://github.com/CBIIT/ctdc-model)$$."
    - paragraph: "$$#ANALYSIS- THE CLOUD RESOURCES:#$$"
    - paragraph: "The CRDC has three Cloud Resources ($$[Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud](http://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/)$$,$$[ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud ](https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/)$$, $$[Terra ](https://terra.bio/)$$),
        each providing analysis platforms for the community to use when working with CRDC data."
    - paragraph: "These cloud-based platforms eliminate the need for researchers to download and store extremely large data sets by allowing them to bring
        analysis tools to the data in the cloud, instead of the traditional process of bringing the data to the tools on local hardware. The Cloud Resources 
        also provide access to on-demand computational capacity to analyze these data. The Cloud Resources allow users to run best practice tools and pipelines 
        already implemented or upload their own data or analysis methods to workspaces."
    - paragraph: "All three Cloud Resources provide support for data access through a web-based user interface in addition to programmatic access to analytic 
       tools and workflows, and the capability of sharing results with collaborators. Each Cloud Resource is continually developing new functionality to improve 
       the user experience and add new tools for researchers."
    - paragraph: "$$*SEVEN BRIDGES CANCER GENOMICS CLOUD (SBG)*$$ is hosted on Amazon Web Services and has a rich user interface that allows researchers to find data of 
       interest and combine it with their own private data. Data can be analyzed using more than 200 preinstalled, curated bioinformatics tools and workflows. 
       Researchers can also extend the functionality of the platform by adding their own data and tools via an intuitive software development kit."
    - paragraph: "$$*INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY CANCER GENOMICS CLOUD (ISB-CGC)*$$ leveraging many aspects of the Google Cloud Platform, allows scientists to 
       interactively define and compare cohorts, examine underlying molecular data for specific genes and pathways, and share insights with collaborators. 
       For computational users, Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources such as BigQuery and Google Pipeline service, 
       allow complex queries from R or Python scripts, or Dockerized workflows to run on data available in the Google Cloud Storage."
    - paragraph: "$$*BROAD INSTITUTE- TERRA*$$ is an open, standards-based platform for performing production-scale data analysis in the cloud. Built on the Google 
       Cloud Platform, Terra empowers analysts, tool developers, and production managers to run large-scale analysis and to share results with collaborators. 
       Users can upload their own analysis methods and data to workspaces or run the Broad’s best practice tools and pipelines."
    - paragraph: "$$*FROM CTDC TO CLOUD RESOURCES:*$$"

    - paragraph: "Researchers find cases/cohorts in CTDC and then identify the files they would like to use for analysis. This list of files is called a Manifest. 
        The user will download the Manifest and then upload the Manifest into SBG where the files will be available for analysis. The user will need a SBG account. 
        The Manifest file is a text file consisting of CRDC Identifiers and, on uploading to SBG, the user will be able to access the relevant data files and see 
        some basic case information."
    - paragraph: "This Cloud Resource analysis model eliminates the need for researchers to download and store extremely large data sets by allowing them to bring 
        analysis tools to the data in the cloud, instead of the traditional process of bringing the data to the tools on local hardware. The Cloud Resources also

    - paragraph: "$$#GITHUB:#$$"
    - paragraph: "As a resource for the public and cancer research, $$[the CTDC GitHub repo](https://github.com/CBIIT/bento-ctdc-frontend)$$ is available for research,
        usage, forking, and pull requests. The codebase is intended for sharing and building frameworks for related initiatives 
        and projects. The CTDC GitHub repo has documentation about how to access the system, including endpoints and recommendations for 
        tools and example queries. Both the project and documentation are currently maintained and updated. "

    - paragraph: "CTDC provides open access to baseline information on the cases present in CTDC. However, the detailed clinical information and associated sequencing data files for cases presented in the CTDC are not open access, they require users to have permission. Requesting permission is a two step process;"
    - paragraph: "STEP 1: Request access through the NCTN Data Archive site."
    - paragraph: "STEP 2: Request access through dbGaP."
    - paragraph: "Once access has been granted, users will be able to view and work with the CTDC data files and clinical information in one of the Cancer Research Data Common’s analysis resources. Currently the CTDC supports analysis via the SBG Cloud Resource ($$[Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud](http://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/)$$)."
    - paragraph: "$$#STEP 1:#$$"
    - paragraph: "Navigate to the $$[NCTN/NCORP Data Archive](https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov)$$ site. If you do not have an NCTN account, please create one. Once registered you will be able to request access to the trial of interest. It is suggested to use either the NCT Trial Number or the PubMed ID to search for the trial of interest- each trial in CTDC has an associated NCT Trial number and PubMed ID. A $$[PDF document](https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/sites/default/files/RequestPDF.pdf)$$ is available detailing the steps for both registration and access requesting."
    - paragraph: "$$#STEP 2:#$$"
    - paragraph: "Navigate to $$[dbGaP’s Authorized Access](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login)$$ site and login. If you do not have a dbGaP account, please create one. 
        If a user is requesting access through a collaborator or their Principal Investigator (PI) who already has access, then the PI/collaborator can add the user as a “Downloader”.
        If a user is requesting access as a PI, then they will need to create a new research project within dbGaP. The following information is useful to add the appropriate dataset to the dbGaP research project request; ARM Q Study Accession ID is phs001926, ARM Z1D Study Accession ID is phs001859."

    title: "CTDC Nodes, Conventions, and Data Dictionary"
    introduction: "Clinical trials in precision medicine generate large volumes of complex biomedical data types- patient metadata, molecular variant profiles and treatment outcomes. To address this complexity CTDC has used a graph structure to model a clinical trial workflow.  Key trial entities have been modelled as node types, while the association between nodes have been explicitly modelled as relationship types. There are 18 node types and 20 relationship types in the CTDC data model, these are listed in the section CTDC Node Types and Table 1, respectively. Both nodes and relationships store data attributes in the form of properties. These data attributes are listed in the section CTDC Attribute Types. The CTDC graph data model has been implemented in Neo4J, a commercial graph database platform."
